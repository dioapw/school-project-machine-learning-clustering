# **Data Preparation, Exploration, and Clustering using K-Means**

## **Problem Explanation**
The problem to be solved here is that the cluster algorithm is able to cluster customer data which will later produce customer data clusters / groupings so that we can see the shape of the data.

## **Dataset Feature Explanation**
- SIM --> 0 : No SIM 1 : Have SIM
- Code_Area --> Area code where the customer lives
- Already_Insurance --> 1 : The customer already has vehicle insurance, 0 : The customer does not have vehicle insurance
- Vehicle_Age --> Vehicle age
- Vehicle_Damage --> 1: The vehicle has been damaged before. 0 : The vehicle has never been damaged.
- Premium --> The amount of premium to be paid per year.
- Channel_Sales --> Channel code to contact customers (email, telephone, etc.)
- Duration_Subscription --> How long has the customer been a client of the company
